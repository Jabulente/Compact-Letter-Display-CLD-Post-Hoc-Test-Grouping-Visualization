<h1 align = 'center'>Compact Letter Display (CLD) | Post-Hoc Test Grouping Visualization</h1>

This repository offers a comprehensive collection of tools and practical examples for generating **Compact Letter Displays (CLDs)** in Python, typically following **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) and **Tukey's HSD** (Honest Significant Difference) tests. CLDs provide a clear and concise way to present multiple group comparison results by assigning letters to groups based on their statistical similarity or difference, making it easy to identify which groups are significantly different. In addition to CLD generation, the repository includes utilities for creating **publication-ready tables**, summarizing **descriptive statistics**, visualizing **data distributions**, and performing **statistical inference**. These features support a complete and streamlined data analysis workflow, making the repository valuable for researchers, analysts, and data scientists aiming to produce accurate, interpretable, and presentation-ready statistical outputs.


## Features

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to explore and summarize data
* Conduct **one-way ANOVA tests** to detect overall differences among group means
* Perform **Tukey‚Äôs HSD** post-hoc analysis for detailed pairwise group comparisons
* Generate **Compact Letter Displays (CLDs)** to summarize statistical group differences
* Create **CLD tables** for easy interpretation and reporting
* Produce **publication-ready summary tables** including group means, standard errors, and CLD labels

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Jabulente/Compact-Letter-Display-CLD-Post-Hoc-Test-Grouping-Visualization.git)
   cd Compact-Letter-Display-CLD-Post-Hoc-Test-Grouping-Visualization
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required Python libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy statsmodels scikit-posthocs seaborn matplotlib scipy
   ```

4. **Exploration**

   * **Jupyter Notebooks:**
     Navigate to the `/Notebooks` directory to find interactive notebooks demonstrating how to perform ANOVA, Tukey‚Äôs HSD tests, generate Compact Letter Displays (CLDs), visualize data, and produce summary tables. These notebooks serve as guided tutorials and practical examples.
   
   * **Python Scripts:**
     The `/Scripts` folder contains modular scripts for data processing, statistical analysis, CLD generation, and table creation. You can run these scripts standalone or integrate them into your own data analysis pipelines.



## üìä Results and Outputs

This project generates a complete statistical summary pipeline, from ANOVA testing to compact letter visualization. Below are examples of the key outputs produced:

1. **ANOVA Table**: Displays variance partitioning, F-values, and p-values across groups.
